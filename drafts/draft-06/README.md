The Grafana Faro Web SDK, part of the Grafana Faro project, is a highly configurable web SDK for real user monitoring (RUM) that instruments browser frontend applications to capture observability signals. Frontend telemetry can then be correlated with backend and infrastructure data for full-stack observability.

The Grafana Faro Web SDK can instrument frontend JavaScript applications to collect telemetry and forward it to the Grafana Alloy (with faro receiver integration enabled), to a Grafana Cloud instance or to a custom receiver. Grafana Alloy can then send this data to Loki or Tempo.
