| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bar Chart**                      | Vertical or horizontal bars to compare categories.                                     | Compare discrete values across groups. E.g., sales by product, population by state, number of clients.       |
| **Line Chart**                     | Connects points to show trends over time.                                             | Track evolution or temporal trends. E.g., monthly revenue, daily temperature, weekly website visits.         |
| **Pie Chart**                      | Circle divided into proportional slices.                                              | Show proportions in small sets (≤5 categories). Avoid if many categories, as it becomes confusing.            |
| **Histogram**                      | Shows distribution of continuous data in intervals.                                   | Visualize frequency distribution. E.g., age distribution, test scores, heights.                               |
| **Scatter Plot**                   | Plots points to show relationships between two numeric variables.                     | Examine correlations, patterns, or clusters. E.g., height vs weight, price vs demand.                         |
| **Area Chart**                      | Like a line chart but with the area below filled.                                     | Show volume or magnitude over time, emphasizing cumulative values.                                           |
| **Boxplot (Whisker Plot)**         | Summarizes data distribution with median, quartiles, and outliers.                   | Analyze dispersion, symmetry, and outliers. Useful for comparing groups.                                      |
| **Heatmap**                        | Uses color to represent values in a matrix or table.                                   | Visualize patterns, correlations, or density in matrix data. E.g., correlation matrix, resource usage.       |
| **Donut Chart**                     | Like a pie chart but with a hole in the middle.                                       | Show parts of a whole while allowing extra info in the center.                                                |
| **Bubble Chart**                    | Like a scatter plot, but bubble size represents a third variable.                     | Visualize relationships between three variables simultaneously.                                              |
| **Radar (Spider) Chart**           | Displays multiple variables in a radial layout.                                       | Compare characteristics or profiles across different groups or items.                                         |

### Tips to Master Charts:

- **Choose the right chart for the question.**
- **Less is more:** avoid overloading with information.
- **Consider your audience:** simple charts for general audiences, detailed charts for experts.
- **Use colors purposefully:** highlight what matters, avoid overwhelming the viewer.
- **Experiment:** sometimes an unexpected chart tells the story better.
